The Employee Review System is a web-based application developed using Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and Bootstrap, with MongoDB serving as the database backend. This system facilitates the employee review process by allowing administrators to assign employees the task of reviewing themselves and providing valuable feedback. Administrators can manage employee profiles, set review criteria and deadlines, and access comprehensive overviews of ongoing and completed reviews. Employees, on the other hand, can access their review assignments, conduct self-assessments based on predefined criteria, and submit their self-assessments before the deadlines. The system also supports collaborative discussions and additional comments. Automated email notifications keep everyone informed about assignments and deadlines, ensuring a smooth and transparent review process. With role-based access control, secure authentication, and authorization mechanisms, data privacy and security are prioritized. MongoDB stores employee data, review criteria, feedback, and scores, making it a scalable and robust solution for organizations looking to enhance their employee evaluation procedures. Ultimately, the Employee Review System provides a user-friendly interface, fosters better communication, and delivers valuable insights through reporting and analytics, improving overall organizational performance and accountability.
